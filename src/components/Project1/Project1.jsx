          I worked as a UX designer and front-end developer for Rocket Science
          from 2021 to 2023. Rocket Science was L'Oréal Data Lab's partner.
          L'Oréal Data Lab is a division inside L'Oréal Canada that builds
          products using data automation for different divisions in L'Oréal
          Canada to enhance business processes.
          <br />
          <br />
          In this project, I designed and developed a web application for
          L'Oréal Canada's Marketing team. The application was designed to
          provide weekly data of high-search and high-sales keywords on Amazon.

          The L'Oréal Canada Marketing team used to collect data from Amazon
          Seller Central every week to find popular keywords with high sales.
          They needed this data to create L'Oréal products' title on Amazon and
          create effective ads. However, dealing with the large amount of data
          was time-consuming and prone to mistakes.

          would make the app fit better with their brand, as this app will be
          used for internal L'Oréal marketing division. I created a mood board
          as the app branding inspiration.

          I created two logos for this project. The first logo was specifically
          designed for L'Oréal Data Lab, which was my debut project with L'Oréal
          Canada. To represent the interconnected nature of data, I used a
          design featuring a sphere with lines. For the font, I opted for styles
          similar to L'Oréal's, and I included a gold maple leaf to signify its
          Canadian origin, aligning with L'Oréal's brand colors.
          <br />
          <br />
          The second logo was created for the Amazon Keyword Planner app. It
          features a combination of a magnifying glass and a key, clearly
          indicating its purpose for keyword searching. The font I chose
          resembles the style used by L'Oréal, striking a balance between
          simplicity and a tech-savvy, powerful appearance.

          The app primarily used black and brown as its main colors. Different
          shades of gray, light gray, and milk white were added to create a
          sophisticated and cohesive look. Together, these colors effectively
          conveyed the Loreal color theme.

          The web application I designed for L'Oréal Canada's Marketing team
          experienced remarkable success, with a tenfold increase in users
          within a year. The app significantly streamlined their work processes,
          allowing them to efficiently collect essential data on popular Amazon
          keywords. This not only saved them a substantial amount of time but
          also simplified their tasks by 97%, leading to an impressive 20%
          increase in their Amazon sales. <br />
          <br />I received extensive positive feedback from users who
          appreciated the user-friendly and neat user interface. This success
          underscored the significance of crafting designs that genuinely cater
          to users' requirements. It also emphasized the value of teamwork and
          upholding the company's consistent style, even for internal tools,
          which can yield outstanding outcomes. In summary, this project served
          as a valuable lesson in prioritizing user needs, fostering effective
          collaboration, and preserving brand identity to develop a successful
          solution.

          Looking back, this project showed how focusing on what users really
          need and working together can make things better. We made a solution
          that made working with a lot of data easier and improved how people
          use the app. We also learned that keeping the company's style, even
          for apps used inside, is important. This project was a good example of
          how being thoughtful in design and making technology work well can
          save time and help people work better.
