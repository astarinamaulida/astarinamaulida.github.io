          From 2021 to 2023, I worked as a UX designer and front-end developer
          at Rocket Science. PulsarML is a software product of Rocket Science
          that helps users keep track of their data and model performance over
          time. It also has a feature that sends alerts to the right people when
          certain performance measures go beyond acceptable levels. As part of
          this project, I was responsible for designing the website to showcase
          PulsarML.

          In the initial phase of my project, I began by conducting market
          research and analyzing competitors to gain insights into their
          strengths and weaknesses. This helped me identify the competitive
          landscape and understand how others in the field were performing.

        <h1 className="sub-title">PROBLEM</h1>
        <p className="desc">
          In my role as a UX designer responsible for developing a website to
          showcase PulsarML's product and services, my main challenge was making
          complex machine learning monitoring solutions easy to understand. This
          was especially crucial given the tough competition in the field. I
          needed to simplify and explain PulsarML's offerings so that visitors,
          including potential clients, could quickly grasp their value in a
          market crowded with competitors.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-title">SOLUTION</h1>
        <p className="desc">
          To overcome this challenge, I aimed to create a user-friendly website
          that simplified the complex details of PulsarML. The solution involved
          clear navigation, straightforward content, and visuals to explain the
          product's features. This user-focused design made it easier for
          visitors to understand the product.

        <h1 className="sub-title">COLORS</h1>
        <p className="desc">
          I chose purple, blue, and white for the website because I noticed that
          real pulsars are a combination of these colors. They are linked to
          ideas of night, water, and nature, which gives a calming and
          trustworthy feel to PulsarML as a brand.

          I designed the logo using the chosen colors. It features a circle with

          represents the essence of a pulsar.

          In just one month, the website attracted more than ten times the usual
          number of visitors. Users appreciated the well-organized information
          and spent 3-5 minutes per visit, significantly longer than the average
          one-minute visit duration. The branding, logo, and colors made a
          strong and positive impact on users. Users especially liked the visual
          elements like gifs and pictures that helped them understand what
          PulsarML offers. The UI of the PulsarML dashboard was in harmony with
          the PulsarML branding. The community also thrived with over 1,000
          followers on LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord groups.

          I had a great time working on the PulsarML website and collaborating
          with Software Engineers (SWEs) and Machine Learning Engineers. Through
          this experience, I improved my communication skills in meetings and
          gained a deep understanding of PulsarML's technology and goals, which
          helped me design the website effectively. I believe the website has
          the potential to expand in the future, offering special pricing for
          specific services, customer support, and documentation. However, I
          recognize the challenge of scaling up the product and services due to
          limited human resources.
