    'I am new in the web development world, previously I was working in finance. Currently, I have been working as a Software Engineer since December 2021. I have been curious about coding. I was lucky to get a scholarship from the OWN (Ontario Web Developers) Initiative, which funded my study in Lighthouse Labs learning about web development. During the study, I fell in love more with code! Having lecturers and friends who are passionate about coding makes me want to develop more. Currently, I am learning typescript, gatsby, C# and plan to learn React Native.',

    'I have unique perspectives as I have web development skills strengthened by my bachelor\'s in business management with finance, which provides logic and business acumen. I enhanced my visual and artistic design from a fashion design diploma from Milan where I learned a lot about colour palette trends, proportions, product designs and more.',
